## **Introduction**

Text generation is the task of generating text with the goal of appearing indistinguishable to human-written text.
Text generation is a subfield of natural language processing. It leverages knowledge in computational linguistics and artificial intelligence to automatically generate natural language texts, which can satisfy certain communicative requirements.
Text is a form of sequence data, to a neural network it is but a sequence of digits. Sequences like text can be generated by training a deep learning model to predict the next word (for text) given a sequence of words. For example, given an input “the cat is on the ma,” the network is trained to predict the letter t, the next character.
